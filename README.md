# poolRNAseq-SNP-analysis
The repository contains analysis scripts for identifying and analysing SNPs from pooled RNA-seq data in organisms that reproduce via clonal and sexual reproduction. The workflow includes read mapping, SNP calling, filtering, and population-level comparisons tailored to mixed-mode reproductive systems, here microalgae (Symbiodiniaceae).

The analyses and scripts are assocaited with the manuscript: Buerger et al., in prep.
